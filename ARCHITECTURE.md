# Oase - Family Finance App
## Final Architecture & Handover Documentation

### 1. Overview
Oase is a modern, responsive Family Finance application designed for simplicity ("Premium Feel") and functionality. 

**Core Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TailwindCSS, Framer Motion.
- **Backend/DB**: PocketBase (Admin, Auth, Database).
- **Hosting**: Designed for Vercel/Self-hosted (Currently Local).

### 2. Key Features Implemented

#### A. Authentication & Family Isolation
- **Multi-User**: Supports `admin` and `member` roles.
- **Family ID**: All data (Transactions, Accounts, Budgets) is isolated by `family_id`. Users only see their own family's data.

#### B. Financial Core
- **Accounts**: Manage Bank, Cash, and E-Wallet accounts.
- **Transactions**: 
    - Income, Expense, Transfer.
    - **Smart Form**: Pre-filled data via URL params (used by Reminders).
- **Budgets (Global)**:
    - Simplified to a **Single Monthly Limit** for the whole family (as per schema constraints).
    - Visual progress bars with "Safe", "Warning", and "Over Budget" states.

#### C. Reminders ("Jatah")
- Recurring bill tracking.
- **"Pay Now" Flow**: One-click payment that opens the Transaction Form with `Amount`, `Title` (Note), and `Date` already filled in.

#### D. Reports & Analytics
- Monthly Breakdown.
- **Visual Charts**: Lightweight CSS-only charts for daily spending.
- Net Savings calculation.

#### E. Premium UI/UX
- **Smooth Transitions**: Page fades and staggered entry animations.
- **Mobile First**:
    - **Bottom Navigation** for mobile users.
    - **FAB (Floating Action Button)** for quick "Add Transaction".
    - **Swipe-friendly** tables (horizontal scroll).
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders instead of spinners.

### 4. PocketBase Schema Notes
The application is synced with the current local PocketBase schema.
- **Budgets**: Uses `amount_limit` on a per-family basis (Global).
- **Transactions**: Linked to `accounts`, `categories`, and `users`.
